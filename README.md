# Restaurant Order Analysis

Project Summary

This project involves analysing and querying a restaurant's menu items and order details to extract insights, such as identifying popular items, pricing trends, and customer order behaviour. Two main tables, menu_items and order_details, are used to address a series of business-related questions through SQL queries.

Objectives

•	Analyse the total number of items on the menu and identify the least and most expensive items.
•	Examine Italian dishes on the menu and determine their price range.
•	Group dishes by category to count them and calculate the average price for each category.
•	Investigate order details to find the date range, number of items ordered, and identify orders with the most items.
•	Combine menu_items and order_details to analyse the least and most ordered items and find the highest spend orders.
